  <h2>Who Can Be a Friend? Everyone!</h2>
  
  <p>Anyone can become a Friend of Arte Del Mundo, and help this worthy enterprise
     to grow and prosper. You don't have to know anything about art. In fact, one
     of the benefits of becoming a Friend is that you can learn about various kinds
     of art, and how the artists create their works. See the benefits list below.</p>

  <h2>The Cost is Minimal and the Benefits are Many!</h2>
  
  <p>The cost to be a Friend is only 20 USD per year, and provides some nice benefits
     beyond just the satisfaction of knowing you are helping local artists fulfill 
     their dreams:</p>
     
  <ul>
  
    <li><p>Friends receive a quarterly newsletter by email. Fascinating articles 
           give friends the latest in art news, as well as an inside look at the
           lives and the secrets of our family of artists. Amaze your in-person 
           friends at your next gathering with your detailed knowledge of the 
           secrets of hand-woven tapestries, hand-dipped candles, and so much 
           more. To be a Friend is to have a whole new world open to you, one 
           artist at a time.</p></li>
           
    <li><p>Friends receive email notifications about all new products 
           approximately two weeks prior to their public posting on this side.</p></li>
           
    <li><p>Friends may opt to meet in person at Friends events, if a group has 
           been started in your area.</p></li>
