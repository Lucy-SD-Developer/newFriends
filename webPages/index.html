    <p>Arte Del Mundo&#174 is a non-profit service that allows individual local
       artists and craftspersons around the world to be able to market their 
       products directly to a global audience. These fine products are handcrafted

       stores when you purchase directly from the artist that produced the goods.

       via the artists themselves. We're here to facilitate and inform.</p>
    
    <p>Arte Del Mundo people are in two general categories.</p>
    
    <ul>
    
    <li><p>First and foremost are the artists themselves, known as Member 
           Artists.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Secondly, there is a large group of important people, people who like
           to help Arte Del Mundo grow and prosper. These are officially Friends
